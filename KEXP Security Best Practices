## Introduction to Security at KEXP

At KEXP Shipping, we take the security of your data and our systems seriously. This guide helps you understand how we protect our shipping platform and what to do if you notice something suspicious. Whether you're new to our security protocols or need a refresher, you'll find everything you need to know right here.

## Understanding Security Incidents

### What Counts as a Security Incident?

Security incidents come in different shapes and sizes. Let's break down what to look for:

**Minor Concerns** - Things like:
- Having trouble logging into your account
- Noticing unusual system behavior
- Seeing unexpected error messages

These issues might seem small, but they're worth reporting. They help us catch potential problems early.

**Moderate Issues** - More serious situations such as:
- Multiple users experiencing system problems
- Suspicious emails or phishing attempts
- Brief service interruptions
- Unusual account activity

**Major Incidents** - Our highest priority concerns:
- Data breaches
- System-wide outages
- Ransomware attacks
- Customer data exposure
- Extended service disruptions

## What to Do When You Spot a Problem

### First Steps (The First Hour is Critical)

If you notice something wrong, don't panic. Here's what to do:

1. Document what you've noticed. What looks unusual? When did you first see it?
2. Contact our Security Response Team immediately at sec-lead@kexpshipping.com or call our emergency hotline at 1-800-SEC-KEXP
3. Don't try to fix the problem yourself - this helps us investigate properly
4. Keep any evidence (screenshots, emails, error messages)

Our security team will take it from there. They'll work quickly to:
- Assess the situation
- Protect affected systems
- Start fixing the problem
- Keep you informed

### After We're Notified

Our team springs into action with a carefully planned response:

First, we contain the problem to prevent it from spreading. Think of it like putting a fence around the affected area. Then we:
- Block any compromised accounts
- Back up important data
- Investigate what happened
- Fix the underlying issue
- Test to make sure everything's working properly

## Keeping Your Account Secure

### Daily Security Best Practices

Security works best when everyone helps. Here's how you can protect your account and our platform:

**Strong Passwords Matter**
Create passwords that are hard to guess but easy to remember. A good trick is using a phrase you'll remember with some numbers and special characters mixed in.

**Two-Factor Authentication**
Always use two-factor authentication - it's like having a second lock on your door. We'll help you set it up if you haven't already.

**Watch Your Network**
- Use secure Wi-Fi connections
- Be careful on public networks
- Keep your work device's security up to date

**Handle Data Carefully**
- Only share information with authorized people
- Use encrypted connections when possible
- Log out when you're done working
- Don't save passwords in your browser

## Staying Safe Online

### Smart Security Habits

Good security is about building good habits. Here are some tips that help keep everyone safe:

**Email Safety**
- Be careful with unexpected attachments
- Double-check unusual requests
- Verify sender addresses carefully

**File Sharing**
- Use our approved sharing methods
- Password-protect sensitive files
- Double-check recipient lists

**Device Security**
- Keep your software updated
- Use antivirus protection
- Lock your screen when stepping away
