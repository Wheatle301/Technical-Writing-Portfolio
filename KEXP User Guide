# Welcome to the KEXP Shipping Platform

Welcome aboard! This guide will help you navigate our shipping platform and make the most of its features. Whether you're sending your first package or managing multiple shipments, we've got you covered with everything you need to know.

## Getting Started

Before diving in, let's make sure you have everything you need to use the platform effectively. You'll need a modern web browser (we recommend Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and a stable internet connection. The platform works best on screens with at least 1280 x 720 resolution, so most laptops and desktop computers will work perfectly.

### Logging Into Your Account

Getting started is simple. Visit portal.kexpshipping.com and enter your email address and password. If you're part of a company account, you'll also need your Company ID. Don't worry if you've forgotten any of these ‚Äì just click the "Need Help?" link below the login form, and we'll guide you through the recovery process.

When you log in for the first time, we'll ask you to set up two-factor authentication. This extra security step helps protect your shipping account, and we'll walk you through the setup process step by step.

## Finding Your Way Around

Once you're logged in, you'll see your personalized dashboard. Think of this as your shipping command center ‚Äì everything you need is just a click away. Let's explore what you can do:

### Your Dashboard at a Glance

The main screen shows you the information that matters most:
- Your recent shipments
- Packages currently in transit
- Any alerts or notifications
- Quick access to create new shipments

On the left side of your screen, you'll find the main menu. This is where you can access all the platform's features:
- Create New Shipments

## Creating Your First Shipment

Ready to send a package? Creating a new shipment is straightforward. Click the "Create New Shipment" button at the top of your dashboard, and we'll guide you through the process.

### Step-by-Step Shipping

First, we'll ask for the basics:
1. Where is the package coming from? Enter the pickup or sender's address.
2. Where is it going? Add the destination address.
3. Tell us about the package ‚Äì its size, weight, and what's inside.
4. Choose how fast it needs to get there (service level).
5. Add any special instructions if needed.

We'll show you available shipping rates based on your information. Pick the option that works best for you, and you're ready to create your shipment.

### Need to Ship Multiple Packages?

If you're sending lots of packages, our bulk upload feature will save you time. Look for the "Bulk Upload" option in the shipping menu. We provide a template you can fill out with all your shipment details at once. Download it, fill it in, and upload it back to the platform. We'll help you review everything before finalizing your shipments.

## Tracking Made Simple

Keeping an eye on your shipments is easy. From your dashboard, click on "Tracking" to see all your active shipments. Each shipment shows:
- Current location
- Estimated delivery date
- Status updates
- Delivery confirmation (once delivered)

Want updates automatically? Set up notifications, and we'll let you know when:
- Your package is picked up
- It reaches major checkpoints
- It's out for delivery
- It's been delivered

## Making Sense of Your Shipping Data

Understanding your shipping patterns helps you ship smarter. Visit the "Reports" section to see:
- How much you're shipping
- Where most of your packages go

You can customize these reports to show exactly what you need to know. Filter by date, location, or service type, and export the data if you need to share it or analyze it further.
